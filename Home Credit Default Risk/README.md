This is my solution of the Kaggle Competition [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) which focuses on trying to predict which clients had payment difficulties in their loan applications. The information for the competition was given in the datasets:
1. application train/test
2. bureau 
3. bureau balance
4. POS_CASH balance
5. Credit card balance
6. Previous applications
7. Instalment payments
